			<h3>About me</h3>
			<p>
				I moved to NYC with my wife this February due to her company relocating. I had been self studying web development for just under a year between
				 my old job working on the London Underground, it was a big change considering I had only ever worked in the heavy construction/engineering sector since leaving school.
			</p>
			<p>
				Its been tough learning using on line resources but I can't think of anything else that I'd rather be doing, for me I love the fact that I can take an idea and build from the ground up;
				 I'm not afraid to learn and fill in the gaps as I go along. I really enjoy designing and building applications and know this is where my future lies.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have begun studying electronics fundamentals in my spare time to enable me to build more advanced hobby projects using my Arduino micro-controller.
				 I've seen some great things built for the IoT and want to be a part of that.

			<h3>Front End Developement</h3>
			<p>
			  I have been building web applications using the core front end technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
			  and also explored and experimented with other frameworks such as the Handlebars templating markup and the Meteor framework.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		      I've added HTML5 functionality to applications (Nyise web App) using LocalStorage, Geolocation and WebSockets which has been interesting and
		      have had the opportunity to experiment with Google GeoLocations API (FrostBytes web-app) including features such as distance calculations and map markers.
             </p>
		   <p>
			 I have also began working with SASS at a very basic level declaring variables and mixins, and working with nested statements.
		   </p>
		   <p>
			I really enjoy working with JavaScript and with each project am becoming more confident with the language. The applications I am working on have allowed
			 me to understand more intermediate concepts such as closures, promises, different data structures and new ES6 collections.
		 </p>
		 <p>
			Although I'm comfortable with HTML/CSS but I know that I need to focus more on my core CSS as my projects in the past have relied on a frameworks such as Bootstrap.
			 I have been taking online courses provided by Lynda and Treehouse and handcoded a responsive grid to gain better understanding of how modern frameworks work

			<h3>Back End Developement</h3>
			<p>
				After seeing great things happen using the Meteor framework while building FrostBytes, I realized I didn't actually understand how each individual component of the
				 application was working...I was just gluing bits together, This encouraged me to begin working with Node/Express, MongoDB and Handlebars separately to understand
				 what each component did within the application, and how it did it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I began by serving static pages from my own node server and then working with express to serve dynamic content pulled from a noSQL databases, rendered
				 client side with help of Handlebars templating markup.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have implemented persistence with a noSQL database in both Node and Java and wrote simple create and read statements .
				 I have begun studying SQL database fundamentals/terminology but I have yet actually implement anything.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also studied part of the CISCO CCNA syllabus and experimented with GNS3 network simulator building simple LAN and WAN networks for a
				 better understanding of how networks are built, configured and operate.
			</p>
			<p>
				I understand that I still have quite limited knowledge of the back-end , but I know that I'm on the right road with getting the basics
				 down and building more complex applications as the time goes on.

			<h3>Android Development</h3>
			<p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>
			<p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
			<p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
			<p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license identical to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" title="View the Zen Garden's license information.">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work.</p>
